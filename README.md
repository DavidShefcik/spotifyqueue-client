This is the client for my Spotify Queue project. This project was to allow for a host to connect their Spotify account to the website and have a queue of music played from it. Users could join the queue session using a 6 digit code. Users could then add music to the host's music queue.

## Technology
This was built using:
- React.js
- CSS Modules
- Apollo GraphQL client
- Webpack
- Babel
- eslint

## Deployment
This project is not deployed at the moment.
